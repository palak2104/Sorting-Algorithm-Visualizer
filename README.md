# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer
The Project works as a website that helps in visualizing various sorting algorithms by showing the modification of the position of random data at the run time.
User can sucessfuly visualize algorithms like:
Bubble Sort
Selection Sort
Insertion Sort
Quick Sort
Merge Sort
I plan to add more complex algorithms into this in future using react framework.
